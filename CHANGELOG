** Simsphere Version 0.1 Release **

October 29, 2019 -- Art Person

This is the first release of the fortran 90 code base that has been tested
against the original fortran 77 code from circa 1996 and produces the same
results.  The following modifications were made to fix some bugs in the
fortran 90 conversion:

  - Variables that needed to be preserved between calls were added to calling
    arguments for air.f90, below.f90, flux.f90, pslcal.f90, vel.f90 and water.f90.
    In the prior fortran 77 framework, these variables were preserved automatically
    between calls.

  - The original avr (average) code was re-implemented for smoothing of the
    evaporative flux over 4 time steps.

  - Removed unused variables PHIH and X1 from bri.f90.  Removed unused variable X1
    from mom.f90.

  - Discontinued the interpretation of decimal values of latitude and longitude
    as degrees and minutes in favor of a simple decimal interpretation. Prior versions
    would treat a value such as 25.39 as 25 degrees, 39 minutes.  The current
    implementation treats such values as a simple decimal number (25.39 degrees).
    This was implemented in calc.f90.

  - Eliminated the input temperature and wind level counts for the sounding in favor of
    using the number of levels presented in the sounding data to determine the counts.

  - Corrected the equation calculating KMA in daykm.f90 to match what appears in the
    original fortran 77 as well as the C++ version of the codes.

  - Added code to snding.f90 to copy the geostrophic wind from the input variables
    wind%ugs and wind%vgs into ugs and vgs where they are used during execution.
    Prior versions were not using the input geostrophic winds.

  - Added formatted textual output (o_model.dat) as an alternative to the JSON formatted
    output (o_model.json).  A summary of the input values used to run the model are
    included in the textual output.

  - Determined that cld_fract is to be interpreted as tenths of cloud coverage and
    implemented input values accordingly.  The C++ version of the code appears to
    interpret this value as a percentage.  In future releases, this may be changed
    to an actual decimal fraction.

  - Fixed testing codes for calling argument changes as well as changes in acceptance
    values due to fixes applied to the code base.  Updates were applied to test_air.f90,
    test_average.f90, test_daykm.f90, test_flux.f90, test_load_data.f90, test_netrad.f90,
    test_output.f90, test_pslcal.f90, test_vegval.f90, test_water.f90 and tests.f90.

  - Original (ca 1996) versions of the input data files are included in the data/orig
    directory.  Tested, matching versions of the input and output data files for the
    fortran 77 and fortran 90 versions of the code are included in data/testing.

  - Tweaked output values in config_gen.f90 to match the testing defaults.  Tweaked
    acceptance values in test_load_data.f90 to reflect these changes.

  - Implemented this CHANGELOG.

Some changes that were made to the fortran 90 port prior to this release were:

- Fixed 2-cycle loops in bri.f90 and mom.f90.
- Fixed routine dectim in calc.f90 to return decimal time in seconds.
- Fixed misnamed humidity variable name to windsnd (wind sounding) in:
     config_gen.f90
     config_mod.f90
     loadjson.f90
     main.f90
     simsphere_mod.f90
     snding.f90
     start.f90
     test_load_data.f90
     test_snding.f90
- Updated variable name Celsius_To_Kelvin in constants_mod.f90 to name
     Celsius_to_Kelvin to be consistent with the other code portions.
- Fixed use of variable MOL in daykm.f90 to allow for exponent of negative numbers.
- Removed unused variable XMOD from globals.f90.
- Fixed time variables in main.f90 to use values of seconds.
- Removed (commented-out) met, veg and soil variables from main.f90 since they are not referenced.
- Added "SAVE" characteristic to local variables in mom.f90 that are initialized and reused upon reentry.
- Fixed routine Lwdown to use global variable Lwdn instead of defining a local variable.
- Replace all occurences of 273.15 or 273.23 with the variable Celsius_to_Kelvin.
- Disabled the saving of the variable "thick" in snding.f90 due to apparent mis-use.
- Added missing second wind direction level to wind sounding for default input data.
- Removed unused variable xmod from test_bri.f90.
- Adjusted tests in test_calc.f90 to accomodate times in seconds.

Original Fortran 90 code conversion and unit test development was by Tom Canich.
